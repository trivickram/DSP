%exp3-system response and stability analysis using ztransform
%theory-Consider the transfer function of a discrete-time LTI system:

H(z) = Y(z) / X(z) = (b₀ + b₁z⁻¹ + b₂z⁻² + ... + bₙz⁻ⁿ) / (1 + a₁z⁻¹ + a₂z⁻² + ... + aₘz⁻ᵐ)

where:

b₀, b₁, ..., bₙ are the numerator coefficients
a₁, a₂, ..., aₘ are the denominator coefficients
n is the order of the numerator polynomial
m is the order of the denominator polynomial
The poles and zeros of the system are determined by the roots of the denominator and numerator polynomials, respectively.

Poles of the system:

The poles are the roots of the denominator polynomial, i.e., the values of z that satisfy the equation: 1 + a₁z⁻¹ + a₂z⁻² + ... + aₘz⁻ᵐ = 0
Let the poles be denoted as p₁, p₂, ..., pₘ.
The stability of the system is determined by the location of the poles in the z-plane:
If all the poles lie inside the unit circle (|p_i| < 1), the system is stable.
If any pole lies outside the unit circle (|p_i| > 1), the system is unstable.
If any pole lies on the unit circle (|p_i| = 1), the system is marginally stable.
Zeros of the system:

The zeros are the roots of the numerator polynomial, i.e., the values of z that satisfy the equation: b₀ + b₁z⁻¹ + b₂z⁻² + ... + bₙz⁻ⁿ = 0
Let the zeros be denoted as z₁, z₂, ..., zₙ.
The zeros do not directly determine the stability of the system, but they affect the transient response and frequency characteristics of the system.
Stability analysis using poles and zeros:

The stability of the system is determined by the location of the poles in the z-plane.
If all the poles lie within the unit circle (|p_i| < 1), the system is stable.
If any pole lies outside the unit circle (|p_i| > 1), the system is unstable.
If any pole lies on the unit circle (|p_i| = 1), the system is marginally stable.
System response analysis using poles and zeros:

The location of the poles and zeros in the z-plane affects the transient and steady-state responses of the system.
Poles close to the unit circle (|p_i| ≈ 1) result in a slowly decaying transient response, while poles far from the unit circle (|p_i| ≪ 1) result in a rapidly decaying transient response.
Zeros close to the unit circle (|z_i| ≈ 1) can cause sharp changes or peaks in the frequency response of the system.
